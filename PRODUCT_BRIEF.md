Hiring is broken. Recruiters spend weeks scrolling through endless profiles, conducting countless interviews, only to find their "perfect" candidate isn't the right fit after all.

It's a costly game where neither the recruiter nor the candidate is always happy.

We set out to simplify this whole process in three steps - Discover, Evaluate, and Hire.

1. Discover Candidates:

With our Intelligent Search, you can simply describe your ideal candidate in words, and set the most qualified matches complete with verified profiles that highlight proficiency.

For example, "Find me senior Gen-AI engineers with LangChain + RAG experience in Europe, open to contract work."

2. Evaluate Candidates:

Review candidate profiles including their GitHub Projects, LinkedIn work history, project portfolios, and professional achievements.

Once you've identified promising candidates, reach out directly or send quick questions to be answered via a video response. This ensures a quick screening process before scheduling formal interviews.

3. Hire Candidates:

# TalentHunt.dev: Product Brief

## 1. Problem Statement

Tech startups and enterprises struggle to quickly fill specialized roles, particularly those requiring advanced GenAI skills. This is due to a combination of factors: the scarcity of qualified candidates, reliance on slow manual sourcing, inefficient and biased screening processes, and an inability to identify modern tool proficiency. Consequently, the average time-to-hire for these critical roles often exceeds 60 days, leading to increased costs, reduced productivity, and delayed innovation.

## 2. Our Solution: An End-to-End Hiring Copilot

We are building an end-to-end hiring copilot powered by a Large Language Model (LLM). Our platform empowers recruiters to bypass the inefficiencies of traditional hiring by using simple, plain-English queries to find, screen, and engage the world's top talent.

A recruiter can simply state their precise needs:

> _"Find senior Gen-AI engineers with LangChain + RAG experience in Europe, open to contract work."_

Our system then instantly returns a list of ranked, de-duplicated candidates. But it doesn't stop there. It proceeds to auto-screen them and helps launch personalized outreach campaigns, dramatically reducing the time, cost, and bias inherent in the hiring lifecycle.

## 3. Core Features (Expected Outcomes)

Our platform will be built around a suite of intelligent, interconnected features:

- **Natural Language Talent Search ("PeopleGPT"):** A multi-source search engine that understands complex, conversational queries to find candidates across various platforms.
- **Automated Profile Processing:** Ingests and parses resumes and online profiles to automatically extract key skills, experience, and qualifications.
- **Intelligent Candidate Ranking:** A dynamic scoring system that ranks candidates based on their match to the recruiter's specific, query-based criteria.
- **AI-Powered Pre-Screening:** Conducts automated background checks and generates tailored Q&A for candidates, including asynchronous video responses, to gauge deeper insights before the first call.
- **Personalized Candidate Outreach:** Assists in drafting and launching personalized email and social media outreach campaigns to engage top candidates effectively.
- **Talent Pool Analytics:** Provides dashboards and monitoring (e.g., via PostHog) to give recruiters insights into the talent landscape and their hiring pipeline.

## 4. Our Goal & Moat

Our goal is to create the definitive hiring copilot for the AI era. Our competitive moat is the seamless, end-to-end integration of our core features. While competitors may offer point solutions (a search tool, an outreach tool), our platform provides a single, unified workflow—from initial query to candidate engagement—powered by a sophisticated understanding of both natural language and the nuances of modern technical skills. This creates a powerful, compounding efficiency that point solutions cannot match.

## 5. Global Benefits: A Worldwide Talent Marketplace

- **For Recruiters:** TalentHunt.dev breaks down geographical barriers, providing access to a global, verified talent pool. A recruiter in London can find a perfectly matched developer in Tokyo as easily as if they were next door, using a simple, intuitive search.
- **For Candidates:** We empower talent from all over the world to be discovered for their actual skills and experience, not just their ability to optimize a profile with keywords. It levels the playing field, ensuring that the best person for the job can be found, no matter where they are.

## 6. What's Next: Asynchronous Video Screening

To further our mission of reducing fruitless interviews and providing deep insights early in the process, our next major feature is **asynchronous video screening**.

- **How it Works:** Recruiters can send a short list of 1-3 critical questions to promising candidates.
- **Candidate Experience:** Candidates record short video responses at their convenience.
- **The Benefit:** This single feature provides immense clarity for both parties. Recruiters gain a much richer understanding of a candidate's communication skills, thought process, and personality before the first live interview. Candidates get a better platform than a resume to showcase their expertise and passion. It's a powerful tool for mutual qualification, saving everyone time and leading to more successful hiring outcomes.
